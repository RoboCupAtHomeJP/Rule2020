The referee as much as possible to comply with the instructions, for examples, open the door, remove the chair, grasp thing and put it on hand, and others, that the robot indicates clearly. However, it can not cope with the points beyond the limits of the referee, such as voices too small, inability to hear instructions in English or Japanese that are not the native language, or small images that can not be read, etc.
